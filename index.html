          <h1>ABOUT ME.</h1>
          <p>Hey Class of 2020! My name is Timothy Chang and I’m running to be your class treasurer! As the class social manager for the past year, I have gained the necessary skills to continue working alongside all of you guys and ensure an unforgettable senior year. From putting on an extraordinary homecoming performance to planning and organizing Jprom, serving on council this year has been a wild ride. Having the privilege to positively impact the school community motivates me every day and I would love to continue serving you as a class representative. Taking part in school wide and class events such as homecoming, powderpuff, and even lip dub has strengthened my ability to collaborate and communicate, sparked new friendships, and left me with many unforgettable memories. Looking forward, I hope that encouraging greater class participation will leave us all with a few memories that we can continue to cherish even long after our time at Tino. </p>

          <h1>WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE.</h1>
          <p>Dedication, Compassion, and Exhilaration. With these specific traits that ultimately define my character, I have taken on every task presented, whether seemingly impossible or painfully dull, with optimism and confidence. My experience on council ranges from planning multiple fundraisers to organizing large-scale events such as homecoming and Jprom and I am excited to utilize my experience to guide those who are joining council for the first time. </p>

          <h1>WHAT I PLAN TO DO.</h1>
          <p>Given that it will be our last year at Tino, encouraging greater participation in school wide and class events will be my top priority. Let’s be real, we’ve all experienced staying up till 1AM writing essays, bombing maths test we initially felt good about, and skimming online summaries rather than reading the actual book. But I hope that we all get to have a taste of everything Tino has to offer, from the preparation process for the homecoming decorations and dances to schoolwide sports events. They are a great opportunity for socializing, collaborating, and making new friends. Furthermore, I would like to implement a new volunteering platform that will serve our local community. This may range from helping out at local events to working alongside ASB to serve underprivileged children in or near this area. Such a program would both positively impact the children and also strengthen important characteristics of our students.</p>
